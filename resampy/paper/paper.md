# Summary

This package implements efficient, high-quality sample rate conversion using the
band-limited sinc interpolation method [@RESAMPLE].
This method supports fast sample rate conversion for long and multi-channel signals.
Its functionality and features are similar to `libsamplerate` [@libsamplerate], but it differs by having a permissive (BSD-style) license, and it is written in Cython so that it is easier to
install and use within larger Python projects.
