Introduction
------------
`resampy` is a python module for efficient time-series resampling.  It is based on the
band-limited sinc interpolation method for sampling rate conversion as described by
[1]_.

`resampy` supports multi-dimensional resampling on numpy arrays, and is well-suited to
audio applications.  For long-duration signals --- e.g., minutes at a high-quality
sampling rate --- `resampy` will be considerably faster
than `scipy.signal.resample` and have little perceivable difference in audio quality.

Its dependencies are `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `scipy
<http://www.scipy.org>`_, and `Cython <http://www.cython.org/>`_.


For a quick introduction to using `resampy`, please refer to the `Examples`_ section.

Installation
